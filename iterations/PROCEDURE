RUNNING THOMAS'S CODE
---------------------
notation: `$n` = new iteration number
          `$y` = new iteration number + year (e.g. `i3_2016`)

1. download Steve's corrections and rename it to `FmsCorr.heppel.txt_i$n`
2. `mkdir $y`
3. `cd ../scripts`
4. convert corrections file: 
   `./toRowColumn.py ../iterations/FmsCorr.heppel.txt_i$n \
    ../iterations/FmsCorr.txt_i$n`
   - this will create a file in iterations subdir called `FmsCorr.txt_i$n`,
     which is heppel's file reformatted to be compatible with Thomas's code
5. `cd ..`


6. launch Thomas's program with `./App.py`
7. choose the previous iteration's directory, e.g., `iterations/i[$n-1]_2016`
   when it asks you to choose a directory
   - n.b. use view menu items to see current settings
8. click `edit->modify gains` and choose `iterations/FmsCorr.txt_i$n`
   - n.b. use view menu items to see new settings
9. click `file->save` and choose the new directory, `iterations/$y`
   - important: don't overwrite the old files!
10. click `file->quit` to exit Thomas's program
10.5. (DEPRECATED STEP, but listed here for documentation:
       execute `qt_mask $y` on the new iteration dir; this
       will implement hard ADC offsets on certain pesky channels


11. `cd iterations`
12. edit the `README.md` file for the new iteration
   - add a new section for the new iteration; read through it and make
     the necessary changes; for updating the average voltage changes,
     see the next step
13. draw some plots using `root draw_plots.C'("$y")`
   - the average voltage changes are printed out to stdout and can be
     then copied and pasted into the iterations/README.md file


14. execute `copy_to_fms_map_dir $y` to copy new files to 
    `GUI_MAP` program
    - (modify the script for your system's directory map!)
15. produce iteration tarball: `tar czvf $y{.tar.gz,}
16. `cd ..` 
    `git add -A`
    `git commit -m "ITERATION $n DAY [day applied]"`
    `git push`
17. `pushd /path/to/fms_map_directory/..`; 
    `git add -A`
    `git commit -m "ITERATION $n DAY [day applied]"`
    `git push`
    `popd`
    `cd iterations`


UPLOADING NEW ITERATIONS
------------------------
1. upload new tarball to rcas, ssh to rcas, upload tarball to 
   daqman:~/fmshv/iterations
2. ssh to daqman:~/fmshv/iterations, untar the tarball; chmod 
   the four sh scripts to u+x
(3. in the four console windows, cd to the new iteration directory 
    and run each sh script)
4. upload tarball to fmsled and ssh to fmsled
5. untar the tarball and copy [iterationdir]/setVoltages.txt to 
   hv/setVoltages.[iteration].txt
(6. on ~/hv/console.exe (via cygwin!), run @setVoltages.[iteration].txt 
    and then @lock.txt)
7. go back to rcas ssh
8. upload new tarball to staruser@startrg.bnl.gov, then ssh to it
9. on startrg, cd to /home/startrg/trg/cal/qt/2015, and move the 
   tarball you just uploaded to here
10. untar the tarball in the 2015/ directory; cd ..
11. remove our qt*_tac.dat symlinks (USE rm -i SO YOU DON'T SCREW IT UP)
12. create new symlinks with `ln -s 2015/[iteration]/*.dat ./`; 
    check with `ls -l | grep '\->'`
